methods:
  - name: setGyroUpdateInterval
    summary: The interval in milliseconds, for providing gyroscope updates to the callback.

        If a callback is passed to this method, it will be called whenever there is an update.
        The frequency of these updates can be controlled using the
        <Modules.CoreMotion.setGyroUpdateInterval> method. If no callback is passed,
        the gyroscope data can be accessed using the  <Modules.CoreMotion.getGyroData>
        method. You must call <Modules.CoreMotion.Gyroscope.stopGyroUpdates> when you no longer want your app
        to process gyroscope updates.
        
    parameters:
      - name: callback
        summary: The method to be called when there is an update.
        type: Callback<CoreMotionGyroDataWithSuccess>
        optional: true

  - name: stopGyroUpdates
    summary: Stops gyroscope updates.

  - name: isGyroActive
    summary: Returns a Boolean indicating whether gyroscope updates are currently happening.

        Indicates whether <Modules.CoreMotion.Gyroscope..startGyroUpdates> has been called since 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.Gyroscope..stopGyroUpdates>.
    returns:
        type: Boolean

  - name: isGyroAvailable
    summary: Returns a Boolean indicating whether a gyroscope is available on the device.
    returns:
        type: Boolean

  - name: getGyroData
    summary: Returns the latest sample of gyroscope data.
    description: |
        An app that is receiving gyroscope data after calling 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.Gyroscope..startGyroUpdates> with no callback, needs to periodically
        check the value returned by this method and process the gyroscope data.
    returns:
        type: CoreMotionGyroData
